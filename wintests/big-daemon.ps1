.SYNOPSIS
    Watch one or more folders and launch PowerShell scripts in independent threads as files arrive in the folder

.DESCRIPTION
    Watch one or more folders and launch PowerShell scripts in independent threads as files arrive in the folder

    
    The basic goal of this is to reduce resource consumption if many PowerShell.exe processes might be started at once, for example:
        1.) If you use a SCOM Command notification channel, an alert storm could bring up numerous PowerShell.exe processes and bring your server to a crawl.
        2.) If you run a number of PowerShell scheduled tasks, you could see excessive resource use depending on how the start of these scripts line up.

    Example implementations:
        For use case (1)
            Set up a SCOM command channel to create <alertid>.SCOM in a specific folder.
            Set up this daemon as a scheduled task to watch the folder(s) for .SCOM files
            Set up this daemon to launch a SCOM alert processing script that collects alert info, processes, and sends notification for each alert
        For use case (2)
            Configure scheduled tasks to add powershell scripts to a queue folder, rather than launching them in PowerShell.exe outright.
            Set up this daemon as a scheduled task to watch the folder(s)
            Launch the PS1 using the newFileAsScript parameter
            Caveat:  This would run with the privileges of the account running the daemon.  Configure necessary credential use in the individual ps1 scripts as necessary
        For a quick test, including verbose output, timing out after 1 minute
            Create a folder: New-Item -ItemType directory -path C:\queue | out-null
            Add a test script file to C:\queue.  For example:
                Set-Content C:\queue\testScript.ps1 "Set-Content C:\queue\success.txt 'SUCCESS!'"
            Run the daemon:  & "\\path\to\Invoke-PSDaemon.ps1" -queueDirectory C:\queue -workingDirectory C:\queue -launchertimeout 1 -verbose
            Wait one minutes for script to wrap up (launchertimeout), or press ctrl-c to exit early
            Confirm that the script ran by viewing the log files in C:\queue, or the success.txt file

.PARAMETER newFileAsScript
    Read in the content of each new file and execute it in PowerShell
    
    To reference the file that launched this script, use the following:
    $args[0] = file name
    $args[1] = full path to file

.PARAMETER scriptFile
    Execute a pre-determined script in PowerShell for each new file

    To reference the file that launched this script, use the following:
    $args[0] = file name
    $args[1] = full path to file

.PARAMETER QueueDirectory
    One or more directories to watch for new files

.PARAMETER gciFilter
    Filter when querying QueueDirectory for files.  For example, default is "*.PS1"

.PARAMETER workingDirectory
    Working directory.  In here, we create three folders and a log file:
        CompletedItems - files where processing has completed
        RunningItems - files where processing is currently running
        TimedoutItems - files where processing timed out based on the runspaceTimeout 
        0Processing.log - log file to track results

.PARAMETER logFile
    Path to log file to track results in.  By default, creates 0processing.log in $workingDirectory

.PARAMETER Throttle
    Runspacepool limited to this many threads

.PARAMETER SleepSeconds
    Seconds to sleep between checking for new files in QueueDirectory

.PARAMETER runspaceTimeout
    Minutes to wait until discarding an individual thread that has been running too long

    When a runspace times out, the file that kicked it off is moved to the workingDirectory/timedoutItems folder

.PARAMETER launcherTimeout
    Minutes to wait before running through remaining threads and gracefully exiting the daemon.  Default:  1 hour

    Be sure to set this parameter in tune with whatever you use to launch this daemon.
        For example,
            If I run a scheduled task once a day that launches this daemon, I would set launcherTimeout to 1440 minutes, or a few minutes less to allow for graceful exit
            If I run a scheduled task every 1 hour that launches this daemon, I would set launcherTimeout to 60 minutes, or a few minutes less to allow for graceful exit

    If you close a runspace prior to this graceful exit, files will be left in WorkingDirectory/runningItems

.PARAMETER SleepTimer
    Milliseconds to sleep between several steps - ctrl-f the source code to find where.

.PARAMETER LogError
    If specified, log error details to a filename.error file in CompletedItems folder
